## Plastic Pollution

Plastic pollution has been a growing and non-stop issue manifesting itself all over the world in oceans, shores, landfills, and even ocean life.

The main cause: human consumption and production.


Plastics are inexpensive and durable, and as a result levels of plastic production by humans are high. However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors have led to a high prominence of plastic pollution in the environment.

Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans.

- It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million metric tons (MT) of plastic waste enters the ocean from costal communities each year.
- As of 2018, about 380 million tons of plastic is produced worldwide each year.
